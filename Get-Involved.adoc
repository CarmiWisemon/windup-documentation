* Provide example applications to test migration rules.
* Identify application components and problem areas that may be difficult to migrate.
** Write a short description of these problem migration areas.
** Write a brief guide describing how to solve the problem migration areas.
* link:Execute-Windup[Try Windup] on your application. Be sure to link:Report-Issues-with-Windup[report any issues] you encounter.
* Write an Windup rule to automate the migration process.
** Create a test for the new rule.
