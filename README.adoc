=  Windup 2.0 Product Documentation

Windup project documentation is created collaboratively on the Windup project Wiki site located here: <https://github.com/windup/windup/wiki>. 

This `windup-documentation` repository takes documentation from that site, makes minor modifications, and publishes the pages in single HTML page book format. 

This repository will contain the official documentation when the Windup 2.0 ships.
