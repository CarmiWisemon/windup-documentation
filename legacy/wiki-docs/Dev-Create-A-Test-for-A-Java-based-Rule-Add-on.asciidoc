=== Create a Test for a Java-based Rule Add-on

It is important to write an Arquillian test for every new rule add-on you create. 

* For details on how to write tests for rule add-ons, see http://forge.jboss.org/document/test-your-addon[Testing Your Addons] in the Forge documentation.

* Append your test class name with `Test`, for example, `JavaClassTest.java`. 

* You can find examples of Arquillian rule add-on tests in the {ProductName} source code by searching on `*Test.java`.
