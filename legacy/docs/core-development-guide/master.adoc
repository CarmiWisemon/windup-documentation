= {ProductName} Core Development Guide

== Introduction

This guide is for developers who plan to contribute to the {ProductName} source code base or provide Java-based rule add-ons.

If you are new to {ProductShortName}, it is recommended that you start with the {ProductDocUserGuideURL}[{ProductName} User Guide]. It provides detailed information about system requirements and detailed instructions on how to install and execute {ProductShortName}. It also contains tips to optimize performance and provides links to other sources of information about {ProductShortName}.

If you would like to create custom XML-based rules for {ProductShortName}, see the {ProductDocRulesGuideURL}[{ProductName} Rules Development Guide].

== Get Started

After you configure Maven, you are ready to create, install, and test your first {ProductShortName} Java-based rule add-on.

If you only plan to create custom {ProductShortName} Java-based rule add-ons, you can skip this chapter. However, if plan to contribute back to the core code base, the following sections describe how to access and build the {ProductShortName} source code.
