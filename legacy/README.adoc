= Legacy Items

This directory holds legacy scripts, instructions, and files that were used when the Windup documentation was pulled and transformed from the link:https://github.com/windup/windup/wiki[Windup wiki]. The documentation is now edited directly from this `windup-documentation` GitHub repository.

Everything copied here uses the same structure as if it were still at the main landing level of the repository.

See the `README-legacy.adoc` and `CONTRIBUTING-legacy.adoc` files in this directory for legacy instructions using these items.
