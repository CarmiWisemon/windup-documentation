=== {ProductName} Core Development Guide


==== Introduction

This guide is for developers who plan to contribute to the {ProductName} source code base or provide Java-based rule add-ons.

If you are new to {ProductShortName}, it is recommended that you start with the _{ProductName} User Guide_. It provides detailed information about system requirements and detailed instructions on how to install and execute {ProductShortName}. It also contains tips to optimize performance and provides links to other sources of information about {ProductShortName}.

If you would like to contribute custom XML-based rules, see the _{ProductName} Rules Development Guide_.

==== Get Started

After you configure Maven, you are ready to create, install, and test your first {ProductShortName} Java-based rule add-on.
