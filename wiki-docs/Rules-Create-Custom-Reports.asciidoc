=== Create Custom Reports

.DRAFT

Most custom rules use high-level operations distributed with {ProductName}, such as `Hint`.
Their results will appear in the report automatically - or better said, the respective rule will add it.

When implemeting a brand new rule with your own conditions and operations, you also need to take care of adding the information to the report - either to some existing report (will appear as new box in one of report {ProductName} creates), or create a new report (will appear as a new file in the output directory).

This page describes how to do both.


==== Add Information to an Existing Report

==== Create a New Custom Report

Something like `rules-java/src/main/resources/reports/templates/ignored_files.ftl` might be a good example.
The report itself is created in CreateJavaIgnoredFilesReportRuleProvider.
