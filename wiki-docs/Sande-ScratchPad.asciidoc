===== Application Report

====== Report Index

The first section of the application report page summarizes the entire application migration effort. It summarizes the mandadory, optional, and potential issues that were found. It also breaks the findings down by by type and whether the suggested updates are informational, trivial, complex, need redesign, or require architectural changes. It also summarizes issues by package. 

This is followed by a list of the following additional reports that contain details about the migration of this application. 

[cols="20%,80%", options="header"] 
|===
| Report Name
| Description

| Migration Issues
| The Migration Issues report provides a concise summary of all issues that require attention.

| Application Details
| This provides a detailed overview of all resources found within the application that may need attention during the migration.

| Potential Issues
| The Potential Issues report is a numerical summary of potential issues. While they may potentially require attention, we do not currently have detailed migration guidance available for these items. If you see issues here that require effort, please send them to us for further assistance.

| Unparsable
| This report shows all files that Windup could not parse in the expected format. For instance, a file with a .xml or .wsdl suffix is assumed to be an XML file. If the XML parser fails on it, you'll see that here. Besides that, the information about parsing failure is also present wherever the individual file is listed.

| Remote Services
| This report displays all remote services references that were found within the application.
EJBs 	The EJB report contains a list of EJBs found within the application.

| Server Resources
| This report displays all server resources (for example, JNDI resources) in the input application.

| About
