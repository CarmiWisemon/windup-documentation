=== Known Windup Issues

The following is a list of currently known issues.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WINDUP-73[WINDUP-73]
** If you do not see expected log messages, resort to `System.out.println()` for logging. 
** You may see too much logging, especially from Forge. This is to be expected. 

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WINDUP-197[WINDUP-197]
** Exceptions in Surefire reports are broken due to the way Forge wraps exceptions and the way Surefire handles them. 
** You need to debug or rewrap exceptions using TestUtil.rewrap(ex).
