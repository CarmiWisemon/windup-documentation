==== About the Report

When you execute Windup, the report is generated in the `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY` you specify for the `--output` argument in the command line. This output directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

* `index.html`: This is the landing page for the report.
* `archives/`: Contains the archives extracted from the application
* `graph/`: Contains binary graph database files
* `reports/`: This directory contains the generated HTML report files
* `stats/`: Contains Windup performance statistics

The examples below use the https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear[test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear] located in the Windup GitHub source repository for input and specify the `com.acme` and `org.apache` package name prefixes to scan. For example:

        windup-migrate-app --input /home/username/windup-source/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear/ --output /home/username/windup-reports/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear-report --packages com.acme org.apache

==== Open the Report

Use your favorite browser to open the `index.html` file located in the output report directory. You should see something like the following:

Click on the link under the *Name* column to view the Windup application report page.

==== Report Sections

===== Application Report Page

The first section of the application report page summarizes the migration effort. It provides the total _Story Points_ and a graphically displays the effort by technology. A _Story Point_ is a term commonly used in Scrum Agile software development methodology to estimate the level of effort needed to implement a feature or change. It does not necessarily translate to man-hours, but the value should be consistent across tasks.

* The migration of the *JEE Example App* EAR is assigned a total of 42 story points. A pie chart shows the breakdown of story points by package. 
* This is followed by a section for each of the archives contained in the EAR. It provides the total of the story points assigned to the archive and lists the files contained in archive along with the warnings and story point assigned to each file.

The following is an example of a Windup Application Report.

===== Archive Analysis Sections

Each archive summary begins with a total of the story points assigned to its migration, followed by a table detailing the changes required for each file in the archive. The report contains the following columns.

Name:: 
The name of the file being analyzed

Technology::
The type of file being analyzed. For example:
* Java Source
* Decompiled Java File
* Manifest
* Properties
* EJB XML
* Spring XML
* Web XML
* Hibernate Cfg
* Hibernate Mapping

Issues:: Warnings about areas of code that need review or changes.

Estimated Story Points:: Level of effort required for migrating the file.

The following is an example of the archive analysis summary section of a Windup Report. In this example, it's the analysis of the `WINDUP_SOURCE/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear/jee-example-services.jar`.

===== File Analysis Pages

The analysis of the `jee-example-services.jar` lists the files in the JAR and the warnings and story points assigned to each one. Notice the `com.acme.anvil.listener.AnvilWebLifecycleListener` file has 5 warnings and is assigned 7 story points. Click on the file to see the detail. 

* The *Information* section provides a summary of the story points and notes that the file was decompiled by Windup. 
* This is followed by the file source code listing. Warnings appear in the file at the point where  migration is required. 


In this example, warnings appear at the import of `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` and report that the class is proprietary to WebLogic and must be removed.

Later in the code, warnings appear for the creation of the InitialContext and for the object name when registering and unregistering an MBeans

==== Additional Reports

Explore the Windup `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/reports` folder to find additional reporting information.

===== Rule Provider Execution Report

The `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/reports/windup_ruleproviders.html` page provides the list of rule providers that executed when running the Windup migration command against the application.

===== Rule Provider Execution Report

The `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/reports/windup_ruleproviders.html` page provides the list of rule providers that executed when running the Windup migration command against the application.

===== Individual File Analysis Reports

You can directly access the the file analysis report pages described above by browsing for them by name in the `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/reports/` directory. Because the same common file names can exist in multiple archives, for example "manifest.mf" or "web.xml", Windup adds a unique numeric suffix to each report file name.
