=== Validate Rulesets Against the Schema

To validate XML rules using the {ProductShortName} rule schema, follow these steps.

. Download this XML validator: https://github.com/amouat/xsd-validator https://github.com/amouat/xsd-validator/releases/download/v1.0/xsdv-1.0.zip 
. Extract the ZIP file in to a directory of your choice.
. The xsd-validator requires the schema file to be located on the local file system. Download the {ProductShortName} rule schema from one of the following locations to a directory of your choice.
* http://windup.jboss.org/schema/windup-jboss-ruleset.xsd
* https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/config-xml/windup-jboss-ruleset.xsd
. Run the following command, replacing the variables as follows.
* RULESET_DIRECTORY: The path to the top level folder that contains the rules.
* XSD_VALIDATOR: The path to the extracted xsd-validator.
* XSD_SCHEMA: The path to the local {ProductShortName} windup-jboss-ruleset.xsd file.
