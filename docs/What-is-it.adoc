{ProductName} is a rule-based tool to simplify application migrations.

Running from a http://forge.jboss.org[Forge] environment, the tool examines EAR, WAR, and
JAR deployments (or a project source directory) and produces an HTML report detailing the inner workings of
the Java application to simplify migration efforts. It seeks to make
migrating from other containers to JBoss EAP a piece of cake.

==== How Does {ProductName} Simplify Migration?

{ProductName} looks for common resources and highlight technologies and known “trouble
spots” in migrating applications. The goal of {ProductName} is to provide a
high level view into relevant technologies in use within the
application, and provide a consumable report for organizations to
estimate, document, and migrate enterprise applications to Java EE and JBoss EAP.

These are some of the of the areas targetted by current core {ProductName} rulesets:
