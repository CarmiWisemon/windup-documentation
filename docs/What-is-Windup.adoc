=== What is Windup?

JBoss Windup is a rule-based tool to simplify application migrations.

Running from a http://forge.jboss.org[Forge] environment, the tool examines EAR, WAR, and
JAR deployments (or a project source directory) and produces an HTML report detailing the inner workings of
the Java application to simplify migration efforts. It seeks to make
migrating from other containers to JBoss EAP a piece of cake.

==== Windup 2.0 vs. Windup 0.7.x

Windup 2.0 aims to deliver the same functionality as legacy Windup, however, the internal architecture and rule structure is very different and allows for the creation of much more complex rules.

==== How Does Windup Simplify Migration?

Windup looks for common resources and highlight technologies and known “trouble
spots” in migrating applications. The goal of Windup is to provide a
high level view into relevant technologies in use within the
application, and provide a consumable report for organizations to
estimate, document, and migrate enterprise applications to Java EE and JBoss EAP.

These are some of the of the areas targetted by current core Windup rulesets:

[cols="2*", options="header"] 
|===
|Ruleset
|Description

|Java code
|Reads compiled Java files, determines if blacklisted classes are imported, and if so, continues to profile the resource.

|JSP code
|Reads JSP files, extracts the JSP imports and taglibs, and continues to
profile the resource

|XML configuration
|Reads XML files into a DOM objects and continues to profile the resource.
