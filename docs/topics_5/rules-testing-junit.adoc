= Test the Rules Using JUnit

Once a test rule has been created, it can be analyzed as part of a JUnit test to confirm that the rule meets all criteria for execution. The `WindupRulesMultipleTests` class in the {ProductShortName} rules repository is designed to test multiple rules simultaneously, and provides feedback on any missing requirements.

.Prerequisites

* Fork and clone the {ProductShortName} XML rules. The location of this repository will be referred to as __RULESETS_REPO__.
* Create a test XML rule.

.Create the JUnit Test Configuration

The following instructions detail creating a JUnit test using the Red Hat CodeReady Studio. When using a different IDE it is recommended to consult your IDE's documentation for instructions on creating a JUnit test.

. Import the {ProductShortName} rulesets repository into your IDE.
. Copy the custom rules, along with the corresponding tests and data, into `__/path/to/RULESETS_REPO__/rules-reviewed/__RULE_NAME__/`. This should create the following directory structure.

.Directory Structure
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
├── *rules-reviewed/*  _(Root directory of the rules found within the project)_
│   ├── *__RULE_NAME__/*  _(Directory to contain the newly developed rule and tests)_
│   │   ├── *__RULE_NAME__.mta.xml*  _(Custom rule)_
│   │   ├── *tests/*  _(Directory that contains any test rules and data)_
│   │   │   ├── *__RULE_NAME__.mta.test.xml* _(Test rule)_
│   │   │   └── *data/*  _(Optional directory to contain test rule data)_

. Select *Run* from the top menu bar.
. Select *Run Configurations...* from the drop down that appears.
. Right-click *JUnit* from the options on the left side and select *New*.
. Enter the following
+
** *Name*: A name for your JUnit test, such as `WindupRulesMultipleTests`.
** *Project*: Ensure this is set to `windup-rulesets`.
** *Test class*: Set this to `org.jboss.windup.rules.tests.WindupRulesMultipleTests`.

. Select the *Arguments* tab, and add the `-DrunTestsMatching=__RULE_NAME__` VM argument. For instance, if your rule name was `community-rules`, then you would add `-DrunTestsMatching=community-rules` as seen in the following image.

. Click *Run* in the bottom right corner to begin the test.

Once the execution completes the results will be available for analysis. If all tests passed, then the test rule is correctly formatted; otherwise, it is recommended to address each of the issues raised in the test failures.
