[[add_apps_upload]]
Upload Applications::

You can use the *Choose Files* button to select applications, or you can drag and drop applications into the area provided. This uploads the selected applications to the {ProductShortName} server.

[[add_apps_register]]
Register a Server Path::

Select the *Server Path* tab and enter a path on the server that contains applications to be included in this project. This does not copy the files to the {ProductShortName} server, but instead evaluates the applications in the specified location.
+
This is useful for the following cases:
+
* You want to register an existing directory on the server that contains applications, for example, from a nightly automatic build process. This way, the {ProductShortName} server will analyze the latest versions of applications.
* You want to register an application as an exploded Java archive. In this case, be sure to check the *Directory is an exploded Java application archive* checkbox.

Once you have specified one or more applications for this project, press *Next* to continue.
