= Using Custom Rule Categories

A new category field was added in {ProductShortName} 3.0 that replaces the concept of the severity field in {ProductShortName} rules. The default categories are the same that were available in the severity field: `mandatory`, `optional`, and `potential`. Additional categories, such as `information`, have also been included in subsequent {ProductShortName} releases. You can now add your own custom rule categories and assign {ProductShortName} rules to them.

IMPORTANT: Although {ProductShortName} can still process rules that use the legacy `severity` field, it is recommended to update your custom rules to use the new `category-id` field.

== Adding a Custom Category

. Edit the rule category file, which is located at `<MTA_HOME>/rules/migration-core/core.windup.categories.xml`.
. Add a new `<category>` element and fill in the following fields:
+
* `id`: The ID that {ProductShortName} rules will use to reference the category.
* `priority`: The sorting priority compared to other categories. The category with the lowest value is displayed first.
* `name`: The display name of the category.
* `description`: The description of how the category is intended to be used.

.Example Custom Rule Category
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<categories>
    ...
    <category id="custom-category" priority="20000">
        <name>Custom Category</name>
        <description>This is a custom category.</description>
    </category>
</categories>
----

This category is now ready to be referenced by {ProductShortName} rules.

== Assigning a Rule to a Custom Category

In your {ProductShortName} rule, use the custom category's `id` value in the rule's `category-id` field.

.Example Rule Using a Custom Rule Category
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<rule id="rule-id">
    <when>
        ...
    </when>
    <perform>
        <hint title="Rule Title" effort="1" category-id="custom-category">
            <message>Hint message.</message>
        </hint>
    </perform>
 </rule>
----

Now when you run {ProductShortName} and this rule's condition is met, incidents identified by this rule will use your custom category. The custom category can be seen in the {ProductShortName} report in places such as the dashboard and Issues report.
