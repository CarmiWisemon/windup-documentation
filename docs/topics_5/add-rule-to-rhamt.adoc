= Add the Rule to {ProductName}

A {ProductName} rule is installed by copying the rule to the appropriate {ProductShortName} folder. {ProductShortName} scans for rules, which are files that end with `.windup.xml` or `.mta.xml`, in the following locations.

* The directory specified by the `--userRulesDirectory` argument on the {ProductShortName} command line.

* The `__MTA_HOME__/rules/` directory. `__MTA_HOME__` is the directory where you install and run the {ProductName} executable.

* The `${user.home}/.mta/rules/` directory. This directory is created by {ProductShortName} the first time it is executed and contains rules, add-ons, and the {ProductShortName} log.
+
NOTE: For Windows, this directory would be `\Documents and Settings&#x5c;__USER_NAME__\.mta\rules\` or `\Users&#x5c;__USER_NAME__\.mta\rules\`.
