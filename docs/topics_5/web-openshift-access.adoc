= Access the {WebNameTitle}

Once the {WebName} has been deployed on OpenShift Container Platform, you can access it from a browser. The `deploy.sh` script outputs the link, shown in the example below as `__WEB_CONSOLE_URL__`, to use to open the {WebName}.

.Example: `deploy.sh` Output
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]

...
-> Deploy MTA Web Console ...
Upload, build and deployment successful!

Open __WEB_CONSOLE_URL__ to start using the MTA Web Console on OpenShift (user='mta',password='password')
----

You can also access the {WebName} from the OpenShift console at `__OPENSHIFT_URL__/console/project/mta/overview` by clicking the link in the *MTA WEB CONSOLE HTTP* application. If you renamed the OpenShift project when deploying, replace `mta` in this URL with the name of your project.

NOTE: If the {WebName} does not load immediately, check the status of the project in the OpenShift console to see if it is still processing or if there were errors.
