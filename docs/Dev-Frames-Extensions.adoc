=== Frames Extensions

Windup has several Frames extensions to satisfy its needs.

==== Multiple Types in a Vertex

Frames stores only one type in the _type_ property. To specify multiple types, use the '|' separator. All sub-parts are indexed.


==== Map Handler

TBD

To store a map in a single vertexes properties.


==== Map

To store a map in as adjacent vertices.

[source,java]
----
@TypeValue("MapModelMain")
public interface MapMainModel extends WindupVertexFrame
{
    @AdjacentMap(label = "map") void setMap(Map<String, MapValueModel> map);
    @AdjacentMap(label = "map") Map<String, MapValueModel> getMap();
}
----

See the `FrameMapHandlerTest`.

==== List handler. 

TBD.

To store a list of strings in a single vertexes properties. 
The keys will be 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

==== List

`WindupVertexListModel` offers a generic model for lists of other 
models, which are stored as adjacent vertices.
