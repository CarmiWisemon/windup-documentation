= Using Custom Rule Categories

As of Windup 3.0, a new category field has been added that replaces the concept of the severity field in Windup rules. The default categories are the same that were available in the severity field: `mandatory`, `optional`, and `potential`. However, you can now xref:add_custom_category[add your own custom rule categories] and xref:assign_custom_category[assign Windup rules to them].

IMPORTANT: Although Windup can still process rules that use the legacy `severity` field, it is recommended to update your custom rules to use the new `category-id` field.

== Add a Custom Category

. Edit the rule category file, which is located at `WINDUP_HOME/rules/migration-core/core.windup.categories.xml`.
. Add a new `<category>` element and fill in the following fields:
+
* `id`: The ID that Windup rules will use to reference the category.
* `priority`: The sorting priority compared to other categories. The category with the lowest value is displayed first.
* `name`: The display name of the category.
* `description`: The description of how the category is intended to be used.

.Example Custom Rule Category
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<categories>
    ...
    <category id="custom-category" priority="4000">
        <name>Custom Category</name>
        <description>This is a custom category.</description>
    </category>
</categories>
----

This category is now ready to be referenced by Windup rules.

[[assign_custom_category]]
[discrete]
== Assign a Rule to a Custom Category

In your Windup rule, use the custom category's `id` value in the rule's `category-id` field.

.Example Rule Using a Custom Rule Category
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<rule id="rule-id">
    <when>
        ...
    </when>
    <perform>
        <hint title="Rule Title" effort="1" category-id="custom-category">
            <message>Hint message.</message>
        </hint>
    </perform>
 </rule>
----

Now when you run Windup and this rule's condition is met, incidents identified by this rule will use your custom category. The custom category can be seen in the Windup report in places such as the Report Index and Migration Issues report.
