= Create a {ProductShortName} Run Configuration

Windup run configurations can be created using the Windup button (image:windup.png[Windup button]). A run configuration specifies the project to analyze, migration path, and additional options for the execution. You can create multiple run configurations, and each must have a unique name.

Projects::
Select one or more projects to analyze. Hold the *Ctrl* key to select multiple projects in the list.

Packages::
