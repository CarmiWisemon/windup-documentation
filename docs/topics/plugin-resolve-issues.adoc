You can resolve Windup issues by updating the code manually or by applying a quick fix when available.

== Resolve an Issue Manually

Review the Windup issue details and additional resources and update the source code as necessary. When you update a line of code marked as a Windup issue, the Windup issue will be marked with the stale icon (image:stale_issue.gif[Stale issue icon]) until the next time that Windup is run on the project.
