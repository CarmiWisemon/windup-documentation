= New features and improvements

This section describes the new features and improvements of the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}) {ProductVersion}.

.Support for non-administrators to run {ProductShortName}
For security reasons, the RWX permission set of {ProductShortName} 6.0.0 was configured to allow only administrators to run {ProductShortName}. In Version {ProductVersion}  you can now allow non-administrators to use {ProductShortName} by setting the value of a new parameter, `rwx_supported`, to `false` in the {ocp-first} web console or the {ProductShortName} {WebName}.
