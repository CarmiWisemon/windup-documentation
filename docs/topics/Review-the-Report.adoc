==== About the Report

When you execute {ProductName}, the report is generated in the `OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY` you specify for the `--output` argument in the command line. This output directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

[options="nowrap"]
----
OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY/
├── index.html          (landing page for the report)
├── EXPORT_FILE.csv     (optional export of data in CSV format)
├── archives/           (archives extracted from the application, for information only)
├── reports/            (generated HTML reports)
├── stats/              (performance statistics)

The report examples shown are a result of analyzing `com.acme` and `org.apache` packages in the https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear[test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear] application, which is located in the {ProductShortName} core source repository. The report was generated using the  using the following command.

[options="nowrap"]

WINDUP_HOME/bin/windup --input /home/username/windup-source/test-files/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear/ --output /home/username/windup-reports/jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear-report --target eap --packages com.acme org.apache

NOTE: The incidents and estimated _Story Points_ change as new rules are added to {ProductShortName}. The values here may not match what you see when you test this application.

===== Application Report

[discrete]
====== Report Index

The first section of the application report page summarizes the entire application migration effort. It summarizes the mandadory, optional, and potential issues that were found. It also breaks the findings down by type and by whether the suggested updates are informational, trivial, complex, need redesign, or require architectural changes. It also summarizes the issues by package. 

This is followed by a list of reports that contain additional details about the migration of this application. 

[cols="20%,80%", options="header"]

| Report Name
| Description

| Migration Issues
| The Migration Issues report provides a concise summary of all issues that require attention.

| Application Details
| This provides a detailed overview of all resources found within the application that may need attention during the migration.

| Potential Issues
| The Potential Issues report is a numerical summary of potential issues. While they may potentially require attention, there is currently no detailed migration guidance available for these items. If you see issues here that require effort, please send them to us for further assistance.

| Unparsable
| This report shows all files that Windup could not parse in the expected format. For instance, a file with a `.xml` or `.wsdl` suffix is assumed to be an XML file. If the XML parser fails, the issue is reported here and also where the individual file is listed.

| Remote Services
| This report displays all remote services references that were found within the application.

| EJBs
| The EJB report contains a list of EJBs found within the application.

| Server Resources

====== File Analysis Pages

The analysis of the `jee-example-services.jar` lists the files in the JAR and the warnings and story points assigned to each one. Notice the `com.acme.anvil.listener.AnvilWebLifecycleListener` file, at the time of this test, has 22 warnings and is assigned 16 story points. Click on the file link to see the detail. 

* The *Information* section provides a summary of the story points and notes that the file was decompiled by {ProductShortName}. 
* This is followed by the file source code listing. Warnings appear in the file at the point where  migration is required. 

In this example, warnings appear at various import statements, declarations, and method calls. Each warning describes the issue and the action that should be taken.
