==== Overview

{ProductName} is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of Java applications. 

Running from a http://forge.jboss.org[Forge] environment, {ProductShortName} examines application artifacts, including project source directories and applications archives, then produces an HTML report highlighting areas that need changes. {ProductShortName} can be used to migrate Java applications from previous versions of _Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform_ or from other containers, such as _Oracle® WebLogic Server_ or _IBM® WebSphere® Application Server_.

==== How Does {ProductName} Simplify Migration?

{ProductShortName} looks for common resources and highlights technologies and known “trouble
spots” when migrating applications. The goal is to provide a high level view into the technologies used by the application and provide a detailed report organizations can use to estimate, document, and migrate enterprise applications to Java EE and JBoss EAP.
