= Use of `<MTA_HOME>` in this guide

This guide uses the `<MTA_HOME>` replaceable variable to denote the path to your {ProductShortName} installation. The installation directory is the `{ProductDistribution}` directory where you extracted the {ProductShortName} `.zip` file.

[NOTE]
====
If you are installing on a Windows operating system:

. Extract the `.zip` file to a folder named `mta` to avoid a `Path too long` error. Alternatively, extract the file with link:https://www.7-zip.org/download.html[7-Zip] to a folder of any name you choose.
. If a *Confirm file replace* window is displayed during extraction, click *Yes to all*.
====

When you encounter `<MTA_HOME>` in this guide, replace it with the actual path to your {ProductShortName} installation.
