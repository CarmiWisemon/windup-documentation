= {ProductShortName} Command-line Arguments

The following is a detailed description of the available {ProductShortName} command line arguments.

[NOTE]
====
To run the {ProductShortName} command without prompting, for example when executing from a script, use `--batchMode` to take the default values for unspecified parameters and `--overwrite` to force delete the output directory. Also be sure to specify the required `--input` and `--target` arguments.

See the description for each argument for more details.

.{ProductShortName} CLI Arguments
[cols="40%,60%a",options="header",]
|====
|Argument |Description
|--additionalClassPath |A space-delimited list of additional JAR files or directories to add to the class path so that they are available for decompilation or other analysis.
|--addonDir |Add the specified directory as a custom add-on repository.
|--batchMode |Flag to specify that {ProductShortName} should be run in a non-interactive mode without prompting for confirmation. This mode takes the default values for any parameters not passed in to the command line.
|--debug |Flag to run {ProductShortName} in debug mode.
|--discoverPackages |Flag to list all available packages in the input binary application.
|--enableClassNotFoundAnalysis |Flag to enable analysis of Java files that are not available on the class path. This should not be used if some classes will be unavailable at analysis time.
|--enableCompatibleFilesReport |Flag to enable generation of the Compatible Files report. Due to processing all files without found issues, this report may take a long time for large applications.
|--enableTattletale |Flag to enable generate a Tattletale report for each application.
|--excludePackages |A space-delimited list of packages to exclude from evaluation. For example, entering `com.mycompany.commonutilities` would exclude all classes whose package name begins with `com.mycompany.commonutilities`.
|--excludeTags |A space-delimited list of tags to exclude. When specified, rules with these tags will not be processed. To see the full list of tags, use the `--listTags` argument.
|--explodedApp |Flag to indicate that the provided input directory contains source files for a single application. See the xref:input_file_type_arguments[Input File Argument Tables] for details.
|--exportCSV |Flag to export the report data to a CSV file on your local file system. {ProductShortName} creates the file in the directory specified by the `--output` argument. The CSV file can be imported into a spreadsheet program for data manipulation and analysis. For details, see xref:export_csv[Export the Report in CSV Format].
|--help |Display the {ProductShortName} help message.
|--immutableAddonDir |Add the specified directory as a custom read-only add-on repository.
|--includeTags| A space-delimited list of tags to use. When specified, only rules with these tags will be processed. To see the full list of tags, use the `--listTags` argument.
|--input |A space-delimited list of the path to the file or directory containing one or more applications to be analyzed. This argument is required. See xref:input_argument[Specify the Input] for more information.
|--install |Specify add-ons to install. The syntax is `__GROUP_ID__:__ARTIFACT_ID__[:__VERSION__]`. For example, `--install core-addon-x` or `--install org.example.addon:example:1.0.0`.
|--keepWorkDirs| Flag to instruct {ProductShortName} to not delete temporary working files, such as the graph database and unzipped archives. This is useful for debugging purposes.
|--list| Flag to list installed add-ons.
|--listSourceTechnologies| Flag to list all available source technologies.
|--listTags| Flag to list all available tags.
|--listTargetTechnologies| Flag to list all available target technologies.
|--mavenize| Flag to create a Maven project directory structure based on the structure and content of the application. This creates `pom.xml` files using the appropriate Java EE API and the correct dependencies between project modules. See also the `--mavenizeGroupId` option.
|--mavenizeGroupId| When used with the `--mavenize` option, all generated `pom.xml` files will use the provided value for their `<groupId>`. If this argument is omitted, {ProductShortName} will attempt to determine an appropriate `<groupId>` based on the application, or will default to `com.mycompany.mavenized`.
|--online |Flag to allow network access for features that require it. Currently only validating XML schemas against external resources relies on Internet access. Note that this comes with a performance penalty.
|--output |Specify the path to the directory to output the report information generated by {ProductShortName}. See xref:output_argument[Specify the Output Directory] for more information.
|--overwrite |Flag to force delete the existing output directory specified by `--output`. If you do not specify this argument and the `--output` directory exists, you are prompted to choose whether to overwrite the contents.

[WARNING]
====
Be careful not to specify a report output directory that contains important information!
====
|--packages| A space-delimited list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}. It is highly recommended to use this argument. See xref:packages_argument[Select Packages] for more information.
|--remove |Remove the specified add-ons. The syntax is `__GROUP_ID__:__ARTIFACT_ID__[:__VERSION__]`. For example, `--remove core-addon-x` or `--remove org.example.addon:example:1.0.0`.
|--skipReports |Flag to indicate that HTML reports should not be generated. A common use of this argument is when exporting report data to a CSV file using `--exportCSV`.
|--source |A space-delimited list of one or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. This argument, in conjunction with the `--target` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. Use the `--listSourceTechnologies` argument to list all available sources. See xref:source_argument[Set the Source Technology] for more information.
|--sourceMode |Flag to indicate that the application to be evaluated contains source files rather than compiled binaries. See the xref:input_file_type_arguments[Input File Argument Tables] for details.
|--target |A space-delimited list of one or more target technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to. This argument, in conjunction with the `--source` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. Use the `--listTargetTechnologies` argument to list all available targets. See xref:target_argument[Set the Target Technology] for more information.
|--userIgnorePath |Specify a location, in addition to `${user.home}/.rhamt/ignore/`, for {ProductShortName} to identify files that should be ignored. For additional information on formatting these files, see xref:exclude_files_and_packages[Configure {ProductShortName} to Exclude Files and Packages].
|--userRulesDirectory |Specify a location, in addition to `__RHAMT_HOME__/rules/` and `${user.home}/.rhamt/rules/`, for {ProductShortName} to look for custom {ProductShortName} rules. The value can be a directory containing ruleset files or a single ruleset file. The ruleset files must use the [x-]`.windup.xml` or [x-]`.rhamt.xml` suffix.
|--version |Display the {ProductShortName} version.

[[input_argument]]
== Specify the Input

A space-delimited list of the path to the file or directory containing one or more applications to be analyzed. This argument is required.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--input __INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_DIRECTORY__ [...]
----

[[input_file_type_arguments]]

Depending on whether the input file type provided to the `--input` argument is a file or directory, it will be evaluated as follows depending on the additional arguments provided.

Directory::
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| --explodedApp
| --sourceMode
| Neither Argument

| The directory is evaluated as a single application.

| Each subdirectory is evaluated as an application.
|====

File::
+
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|====
| --explodedApp
| --sourceMode
| Neither Argument

| Argument is ignored; the file is evaluated as a single application.
| The file is evaluated as a compressed project.
| The file is evaluated as a single application.
|====

[[output_argument]]
== Specify the Output Directory

Specify the path to the directory to output the report information generated by {ProductShortName}.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--output __OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY__
----

* If omitted, the report will be generated in an `__INPUT_ARCHIVE_OR_DIRECTORY__.report` directory.
* If the output directory exists, you will be prompted with the following (with a default of N).
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
Overwrite all contents of "/home/username/__OUTPUT_REPORT_DIRECTORY__" (anything already in the directory will be deleted)? [y,N]
----

However, if you specify the `--overwrite` argument, {ProductShortName} will proceed to delete and recreate the directory. See the description of this argument for more information.

[[source_argument]]
== Set the Source Technology

A space-delimited list of one or more source technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate from. This argument, in conjunction with the `--target` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. Use the `--listSourceTechnologies` argument to list all available sources.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--source __SOURCE_1__ __SOURCE_2__
----

The `--source` argument now provides version support, which follows the link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html[Maven version range syntax]. This instructs {ProductShortName} to only run the rulesets matching the specified versions. For example, `--source eap:5`.

[WARNING]
====
When migrating to JBoss EAP, be sure to specify the version, for example, `eap:6`. Specifying only `eap` will run rulesets for all versions of JBoss EAP, including those not relevant to your migration path.

See link:{ProductDocGettingStartedGuideURL}#migration_paths[Supported Migration Paths] in the {ProductShortName} _{GettingStartedBookName}_ for which JBoss EAP version is appropriate for your source platform.
====

[[target_argument]]
== Set the Target Technology

A space-delimited list of one or more target technologies, servers, platforms, or frameworks to migrate to. This argument, in conjunction with the `--source` argument, helps to determine which rulesets are used. If you do not specify this option, you are prompted to select a target. Use the `--listTargetTechnologies` argument to list all available targets.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--target __TARGET_1__ __TARGET_2__
----


The `--target` argument now provides version support, which follows the link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html[Maven version range syntax]. This instructs {ProductShortName} to only run the rulesets matching the specified versions. For example, `--target eap:7`.

[WARNING]
====
When migrating to JBoss EAP, be sure to specify the version in the target, for example, `eap:6`. Specifying only `eap` will run rulesets for all versions of JBoss EAP, including those not relevant to your migration path.

See link:{ProductDocGettingStartedGuideURL}#migration_paths[Supported Migration Paths] in the {ProductShortName} _{GettingStartedBookName}_ for which JBoss EAP version is appropriate for your source platform.
====

[[packages_argument]]
== Select Packages

A space-delimited list of the packages to be evaluated by {ProductShortName}. It is highly recommended to use this argument.

.Usage
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
--packages __PACKAGE_1__ __PACKAGE_2__ __PACKAGE_N__
----

* In most cases, you are interested only in evaluating custom application class packages and not standard Java EE or third party packages. The `__PACKAGE_N__` argument is a package prefix; all subpackages will be scanned. For example, to scan the packages `com.mycustomapp` and `com.myotherapp`, use `--packages com.mycustomapp com.myotherapp` argument on the command line.
* While you can provide package names for standard Java EE third party software like `org.apache`, it is usually best not to include them as they should not impact the migration effort.

WARNING: If you omit the `--packages` argument, every package in the application is scanned, which can impact performance. It is best to provide this argument with one or more packages. For additional tips on how to improve performance, see xref:optimize_performance[Optimize {ProductShortName} Performance].
