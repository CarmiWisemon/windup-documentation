= About the {PluginNameTitle}

The {PluginName} makes application migrations and upgrades faster and easier by bringing {ProductShortName}'s migration assistance to Eclipse and Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio. It analyzes your projects using {ProductShortName}, marks migration issues in the source code, provides guidance to fix the issues, and offers automatic code replacement when possible.
