=== XML Rule Condition - Project Syntax

==== Summary 

Use the `project` element to find information in project files. The following is an example of a rule that tests for an `xmlfile`.

    <rule>
        <when>
            <project>
                <artifact groupId="junit" artifactId="junit" from="MyEjbRule" to="???"/>
            </project>
        </when>
        <perform>
            <hint title="Title for Hint for Project">
                <message>Descriptive message</message>
            </hint>
        </perform>
    </rule>
