=== Troubleshoot Windup Issues

==== Logging

Logging is currently broken and will not be fixed any time soon. 

See xref:Known-Issues[Known Issues] and https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WINDUP-73[WINDUP-73] for the current status.

==== Debugging Exceptions

Exceptions in Surefire reports are broken due to the way Forge wraps
exceptions and the way Surefire handles them. You need to
debug or rewrap exceptions using `TestUtil.rewrap(ex)`. 

See xref:Known-Issues[Known Issues] and https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WINDUP-197[WINDUP-197] for the current status..

==== Classloading Problems

Configuring dependencies in a Forge-based project can be a little tricky.
See xref:Dev-Dependencies[Dependencies] for some hints.
