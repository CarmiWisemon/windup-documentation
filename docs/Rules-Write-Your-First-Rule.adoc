[[Rules-Write-Your-First-Rule]]
=== Write Your First Rule

==== Overview 

This topic guides you through the process of creating and testing your first rule.

{ProductName} XML-base rules use the following familiar rule pattern:

    when(condition)
        perform(action)
    otherwise 
        perform(action)

As you create your first rule, refer to the https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/config-xml/rule-schema.xsd[Rules Schema] for valid XML syntax. 

For more information about XML rule construction, see xref:Rules-Create-a-Basic-XML-Rule[Create a Basic XML Rule].

==== Rule Example Description

In previous releases of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application, you could ensure application class namespace isolation during deployment by defining a `<class-loading>` element in the `jboss-web.xml` file. Due to the change in JBoss EAP 6 to use modular class loading, this element is no longer necessary, and can result in `ParseError` and `XMLStreamException` errors in the server log. This issue is described in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html-single/Migration_Guide/index.html#Create_or_Modify_Files_That_Control_Class_Loading_in_JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform_6[JBoss EAP Migration Guide]. 

In this example, you write a rule to discover instances where an application defines a `jboss-web.xml` file containing a `<class-loading>` element and provide a link to the documentation that describes how to migrate the code. 

==== Create the Directory Structure for the Rule

. Create a directory structure to contain your first rule and the data file to use for testing. 
+
----
$ mkdir -p migration-rules/rules
$ mkdir -p migration-rules/data
----

. This directory structure will also be used to hold the generated {ProductShortName} reports.

==== Create Data to Test the Rule

. Use your favorite editor or IDE to create a `jboss-web.xml` file in the `~/migration-rules/data/` subdirectory. 
. Copy in the following content.
+
----
<!DOCTYPE jboss-web PUBLIC "-//JBoss//DTD Web Application 4.2//EN" "http://www.jboss.org/j2ee/dtd/jboss-web_4_2.dtd">
<jboss-web>
    <class-loading java2ClassLoadingCompliance="false">
        <loader-repository>
            seam.jboss.org:loader=@projectName@
            <loader-repository-config>java2ParentDelegation=false</loader-repository-config>
        </loader-repository>
    </class-loading>
</jboss-web>
----

==== Create the Rule

. Use your favorite editor or IDE to create an XML file in the `~/migration-rules/rules/` subdirectory named `JBoss5-web-class-loading.windup.xml`. Copy in the following content.
+
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset xmlns="http://windup.jboss.org/v1/xml" id="UNIQUE_RULESET_ID">
    <rules>
        <rule id="UNIQUE_RULE_ID">
            <when>
                <!-- Test for a condition here -->
            </when>
            <perform>
                <!-- Perform an action -->
            </perform>
        </rule>
     </rules>
</ruleset>
----
NOTE: {ProductShortName} identifies files with the `.windup.xml` extension as XML-based rules, so make sure to use this naming convention, otherwise the rule will not be evaluated!

. Add the unique identifier for the ruleset and rule.
* Replace the UNIQUE_RULESET_ID with the file name: "JBoss5-web-class-loading"
* Replace the UNIQUE_RULE_ID with the ruleset ID appended with '_001': "JBoss5-web-class-loading_001"
. Complete the `when` condition. 
* Because this rule finds `jboss-web.xml` files containing the `class-loading` element, we use `xmlfile` to evaluate the files. 
* To match on the `class-loading` element that is a child of `jboss-web`, use the xpath expression "jboss-web/class-loading".
+
----
<when>
    <xmlfile matches="jboss-web/class-loading" />
</when>
----
. Complete the `perform` action for this rule. 
* Provide an informative message.
* Provide a link to documentation that describes the migration details. 
* Assign a level of effort of "1" to this task.
+
----
<perform>
    <iteration>
        <classification classification="JBoss Web Application Descriptor" effort="0"/>
        <hint message="The class-loading element is no longer valid in the jboss-web.xml file." effort="1">
            <link href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html-single/Migration_Guide/index.html#Create_or_Modify_Files_That_Control_Class_Loading_in_JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform_6" description="Create or Modify Files That Control Class Loading in JBoss EAP 6"/>
        </hint>
    </iteration>
</perform>
----
. The rule is now complete and should look like the following example.
+
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ruleset xmlns="http://windup.jboss.org/v1/xml" id="JBoss5-web-class-loading">
    <rules>
        <rule id="JBoss5-web-class-loading_001">
            <when>
                <xmlfile matches="jboss-web/class-loading" />
            </when>
            <perform>
                <iteration>
                    <classification classification="JBoss Web Application Descriptor" effort="0"/>
                    <hint message="The class-loading element is no longer valid in the jboss-web.xml file." effort="1">
                        <link href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html-single/Migration_Guide/index.html#Create_or_Modify_Files_That_Control_Class_Loading_in_JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform_6" description="Create or Modify Files That Control Class Loading in JBoss EAP 6"/>
                    </hint>
                </iteration>
            </perform>
        </rule>
     </rules>
</ruleset>
----

==== Install the Rule

A {ProductShortName} rule is installed simply by copying the rule to the appropriate folder. 

Copy the `JBoss5-web-class-loading.windup.xml` file to your `${user.home}/.windup/rules/` directory.
----
For Linux or Mac: ~/.windup/rules/
For Windows: "\Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\.windup\rules\" or "\Users\USER_NAME\.windup\rules\"
----


==== Test the Rule

. Open a terminal and navigate to the {ProductHomeVar}/bin directory

. Type the following command to start {ProductShortName}:
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Linux:    windup/bin $ ./windup
For Windows:  C:\WINDUP_HOME\bin> windup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
. Execute the `windup-migrate-app` command, passing the test data file as the input parameter.
+
----
windup-migrate-app sourceMode true --input ~/migration-rules/data --output ~/migration-rules/reports
----
. You should see this result.
+
----
***SUCCESS*** Windup report created: /home/your-username/migration-rules/reports/index.html
              Access it at this URL: file:///home/your-username/migration-rules/reports/index.html

----
. Access the report at ~/migration-rules/reports/index.html to make sure it provides the expected results. 
* The _Overview_ page displays the *Name* of the input folder, "data", along with the expected *Effort* of "1 Story Points".
+

* Drill down into the _Application Report_ detail by clicking on the "data" link. This report displays the *Name* of the file, "jboss-web.xml", the warning "seam.jboss.org:loader=@projectName@ java2ParentDelegation=false" in the *Issues* column, and displays "1" *Estimated Story Points", as expected.
+

* Drill down into _Source Report_ by clicking on the "jboss-web.xml" file link. This report provides information about the file and summarizes the story points. It also highlights the `<class-loading>` line in the `jboss-web.xml` file, provides the message "The class-loading element is no longer valid in the jboss-web.xml file.", and provides a link to the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html-single/Migration_Guide/index.html#Create_or_Modify_Files_That_Control_Class_Loading_in_JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform_6[Create or Modify Files That Control Class Loading in JBoss EAP 6] topic in the JBoss EAP 6 Migration Guide. Click on the link to make sure the link to the documentation is valid.
